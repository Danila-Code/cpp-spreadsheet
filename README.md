# Spreadsheet

## Description
A spreadsheet is a rectangular table with numbered rows and columns. It stores cells in which numbers, strings, and formulas can be stored. Formulas can contain links to other cells.

## Features
* calculated formulas in cells
* defining circular references and displaying messages about it
* caching of formula calculation results for more efficient operation
* analyzing formulas and cell contents using antlr4

### Using technologies
C++, STL, RAII, smart pointers, algorithms on graphs, object-oriented programming, antl4, CMake

### System requirements
C++ 17, STL, CMake 3.8

## In the future I plan to add
* a graphical interface
* the ability to save spreadsheet to a file
* the ability to load spreadsheet from a file

Now main.cpp implements a simple console application with instructions.
